          C++: Game developers have been building games with C++ for decades.
          C++ allows you to develop games across various platforms, including
          Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.C++ is used in numerous 2D game
          engines and 3D game engines. Unreal Engine, Godot for instance, use
          C++ as their scripting language. The Unity game engine is written in
          C#, but its runtime language is C++. By now, many gaming APIs are
          written in C++. So itâ€™s great for game development, its the first
          choice of Game Devs.

          C# : C# can also be used to build custom tools for game development,
          such as level editors or asset management systems. These tools can
          help streamline the game development process and improve the
          efficiency of the development team. In addition to game engines and
          tools, C# can also be used for game scripts.
