          <SiEthereum className="inline-block mr-2 text-blue-500" />
          Ethereum: Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform, running on
          a peer-to-peer network. It leverages its native cryptocurrency known
          as Ether/ETH to enable secure and verified transactions. By using
          Ethereum, developers gain the ability to construct and launch
          decentralized applications, eliminating the reliance on a central
          authority. In a decentralized application the participants/users of
          the app themselves become the decision-making authority.

        <li>
          <HiWallet className="inline-block mr-2 text-blue-500" />
          MetaMask: MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with
          the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum
          wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be
          used to interact with decentralized applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <SiSolidity className="inline-block mr-2 text-blue-500" />
          Solidity: Solidity is a programming language created by the Ethereum
          Network Team for constructing and designing smart contracts on
          Blockchain platforms. It's used to create smart contracts that
          implement business logic and generate a chain of transaction records
          in the blockchain system.
